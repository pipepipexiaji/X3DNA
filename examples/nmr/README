Multiple NMR structures are handled by a Perl script called "nmr_strs",
which calls "analyze" (or "cehs") to analyze each structure sequentially.
The PDB NMR structure format is assumed. Specifically, each structure has
the following format:

MODEL    SERIAL-NUMBER
............
ATOM RECORDS
............
ENDMDL

The input file is in the same format as for "analyze" (and "cehs"), with the
output file name (2nd line) as the prefix for each structure analyzed (see
1hrz.inp for an example).

By modifying the Perl script "nmr_strs", there should be no big problems to
analyze other kinds of multiple structures, e.g., those from MD simulations.

============================================================================

The best representative structure defined by "REMARK 210" (or the first if
NULL or not defined) can be extracted as follows, using PDB entry 230d as an
example:     ex_str -nmrb 230d.pdb 230d_rep.pdb

The ensemble image can be generated using script "nmr_ensemble" as follows:
                     nmr_ensemble -s=42 -i=230d.jpg 230d.pdb
